		<p>Els-Bels Boutique is run by Oranmore mum Eleanor, who realised that her
			love of sewing, nurtured and developed during Covid lockdown, could give
			pleasure to people other than just her own household. Her attention to
			detail, and love of pairing beautiful fabrics and hardware, mean that her
			bags and accessories are always a special addition to any outfit. And if
			you're searching for the perfect bag to match an outfit for a special
			occasion, Eleanor delights in working with customers to source fabrics,
			patterns and hardware to be able to produce just the bag they're looking
			for.</p>
